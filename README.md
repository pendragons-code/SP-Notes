# SP-Notes
I will be honest, I really really dislike using some of the sites and online resources the school I am attending has elected to use and at the same time the resources are not exactly the most user friendly.    
I will probably sound really spoiled, but I really am speaking as someone who has no idea how to use said resources. While I do not expext to be spoon-fed I thought there was gonna be a better guide on how to use the resources and a lot more info about such things online.    
I will also elaborate that I have no **F@#$ing** idea how to use windows, microsoft products in general and more. The school exepected us to have such knowledge upon entry.    
After sitting down and thinking about it, I realize that it was pretty dumb of me to just go for pfp. Considering the current circumstance I would probably consider ITE.
